# News Homepage

This is a solution to the News Homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor. It is a responsive webpage that displays news articles, with different layouts for different screen sizes.

## Built with

The project was built with the following:

- React.js - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Next.js - a framework for React.js that adds server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and other features
- Styled Components - a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS inside your JavaScript code
- Flexbox and CSS Grid - for layout and positioning
- Mobile-first workflow - designing for mobile devices first and then adding larger screen sizes

## What I learned

This project allowed me to practice my React.js skills, especially with Next.js. I also learned how to use Styled Components for styling, which made it easier to manage CSS in large projects.

In terms of design, I learned the importance of designing for different screen sizes and using a mobile-first approach. This helped me create a website that looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

## Continued development

One area that I would like to continue developing is accessibility. While the webpage is responsive and looks great on different devices, I need to improve the accessibility for users with disabilities, such as adding alternative text for images and improving keyboard navigation.

I would also like to improve the performance of the website by optimizing images and reducing the size of the CSS and JavaScript files.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge and allowing me to practice my web development skills. I would also like to thank the developers of React.js, Next.js, and Styled Components for creating such great tools that make building web applications easier and more enjoyable.
